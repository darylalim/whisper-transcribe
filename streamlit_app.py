# mlx/core is a compiled extension (core.cpython-313-darwin.so). Most mlx
# releases ship a stub package beside it (mlx/core/__init__.pyi and siblings), so
# ty resolves the import and type-checks mx.clear_cache() for real. Whether a
# given release has the stubs is a packaging property, not a version floor:
# 0.31.2 and 0.32.1+ have them, 0.32.0 -- the pin this import was added under --
# did not, and ty exits 1 on a stale suppression, so the directive is coupled to
# the locked mlx in both directions. On a stub-less release this line needs
# `ty: ignore[unresolved-import]` again (line-scoped, not a [tool.ty] rule
# override, so a genuinely missing import still fails). That directive is spelled
# without its leading `#` on purpose: a `#`-prefixed copy anywhere in a comment
# is parsed as a live directive -- reported as unused here, or, on its own line
# above an import that really fails to resolve, silently applied to that import.
# The lockfile pins 0.32.2, so the 0.24.2 floor in pyproject.toml is an
# mx.clear_cache() minimum, not a typing one.

# Transcribe lands at x=784, right=952. The split is not arbitrary — it is exactly
# "inside a bordered card" versus "not". A st.container(border=True) has computed
# padding: 15px plus a 1px border, insetting its content box from 704px to 672px,

# Transcribe sits outside both, so it stays flush with the 704px content edge —

# cache_resource, not cache_data, and the deviation is deliberate: performance.md
# scopes cache_resource to unserializable objects, and bytes are serializable. But
# cache_data stores entries *pickled* and returns a fresh copy per call, so an
# active entry costs three resident buffers — the pickled entry, a per-rerun
# unpickled copy (these fetches re-invoke on every rerun while their tab is open),
# and the MediaFileManager buffer backing the st.audio preview. cache_resource
# hands back the same object and collapses the first two. Safe here only because
# the return is a tuple of immutables: a shared mutable would be a cross-session
# aliasing bug. Note _clear_caches must call st.cache_resource.clear() too.
#
# max_entries=2, not 5, and it is the *only* lever on the memory ceiling. These two
# caches hold raw audio, so the worst case is entries x MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES x 2
# caches -- 5 GB at the old value, 2 GB at this one. ttl looks like it should help
# and does not: Streamlit's ttl_cache expires lazily, so an expired entry reads as
# absent but is only actually dropped by a write, an expire() call, or a
# length/size query. It bounds staleness, not resident memory, and an idle server
# can hold expired payloads indefinitely. max_entries is what bounds how many can
# coexist. The cost of the smaller number is a re-download when a user cycles
# through more than two remote sources inside the ttl window; 2 still covers going
# back to the previous one, which is the common case.
#
# show_spinner=False, and this reverses an earlier decision on purpose. These two
# fetches used to pass a "Downloading audio from..." message on the grounds that,
# unlike _transcribe, nothing wraps them in an st.status and the cache spinner was
# the only progress signal. The st.skeleton in each tab's reserved slot is now that
# signal, and the spinner actively fights it: the spinner is an *extra* element with
# no reserved space, so during a download it grows the slot by its own height and
# pushes the settings card and Transcribe button down ~40px, which then snap back
# when it clears. Measured against a deliberately slow local server, with both, the
# card rendered stale-faded with the spinner text overlapping it; with the skeleton
# alone the page does not move at all, because a skeleton sized to the preview it
# replaces is layout-neutral by construction. Reserving space is the whole point of
# the pattern, and the spinner is the thing that breaks the reservation.

    Two mechanisms, because Markdown has two layers:

    *Inline* constructs are backslash-escaped. A filename containing *, _,
    backticks, brackets, or : (emoji/Material-icon directives) — common in YouTube
    titles and underscored names — would otherwise mis-render. `&` is in the class

    `clip&#58;streamlit&#58;.mp3` decodes to a live `:streamlit:` that the
    frontend's post-parse pass swaps for the logo image, and `Rock &amp; Roll.mp3`
    displays as `Rock & Roll.mp3`. `&` is ASCII punctuation, so `\\&` is a valid
    CommonMark characterEscape.

    *Block* constructs are defused by collapsing whitespace, not by escaping:
    headings, blockquotes, lists, thematic breaks and GFM tables all need a line
    start, so removing newlines removes every one of them at once — a smaller
    change than adding #, >, -, +, | and the ordered-list forms to the class.
    This has to happen here rather than at one call site, because *two* sinks
    render without the frontend's isLabel flag (which is what would otherwise
    auto-escape block markers and strip block elements):

    - `st.error`'s body — AlertElement passes isLabel for the alert title only.
    - `st.subheader` — the heading component does `[first, ...rest] = body.split("\\n")`

    `"0,60,120,180"` → `["0,60", "120,180"]`. A trailing unpaired start keeps its
    open end (`"0,60,120"` → `["0,60", "120"]`), which mlx_whisper reads as
    running to the end of the file.

    This exists because **mlx_whisper does not honour more than one clip.** Its
    decode loop is `for seek_clip_start, seek_clip_end in seek_clips:` wrapping
    `while seek < seek_clip_end:` — `seek_clip_start` is bound and never read,
    and there is no `seek = seek_clip_start`, so `seek` carries over from the
    previous clip and each later range simply continues from wherever the last
    one stopped. Given `0,60,120,180` it decodes 0–180 straight through,
    including the 60–120 the user excluded. (`clip_idx` at `transcribe.py:247` is
    initialised and never incremented — vestigial from the same loop upstream.)
    A single pair is unaffected, because `seek` is initialised to
    `seek_clips[0][0]`, which is why `30,90` was always correct and only the
    multi-clip tail was broken — and why the bug outlived a green test named
    `multi_clip` that asserted only that the string was forwarded.

    Segment timestamps are already absolute — mlx_whisper derives them from
    `seek`, which starts at the clip's own start frame — so segments concatenate
    with no timestamp fix-up.

    `id` *is* renumbered. mlx assigns it per call as
    `enumerate(current_segments, start=len(all_segments))`, so every clip restarts
    from 0 and a plain concatenation carries duplicates — a shape no single call
    ever produces. Nothing here reads `id` (`_format_srt` numbers cues with its
    own `enumerate`), so this is about not handing back a malformed dict rather
    than about a live bug.

    `language` comes from the first clip, and the clips *cannot* disagree: with
    `language=None` mlx detects from `pad_or_trim(mel, N_FRAMES)` — the first 30
    seconds of the **whole file**, not of the clip — so every call scores the same
    window and returns the same answer. An earlier version of this docstring said
